The ground screws in our company are formed by heat-shrinkable processing of steel tube The Ground Anchor have high strength and availability, and we have a leading position across the country. Our products have a cone-shaped body, the lower part of which has a spiral fin. The operation principle is the same as the screws. With the using of mechanical equipment or wrench to spin the GROUND SCREW into the ground, it makes the operation more convenient and efficient. Another function is with the opening of the spiral fin in the lower part; it increases the contact area with the earth, and increases the diameter of the GROUND SCREW. In this way, with the increasing contact area with the earth, it is more closely connected with the earth, and it will be more firm and stable.http://www.ground-screw.com/pid10919195/ground+screws.htm
